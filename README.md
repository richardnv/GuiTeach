Layout:
    Lefty Instructor (default)
        The default layout is intended to be like the view of the guitar neck your left handed instructor, sitting directly in front of you.
        (Low strings are on top, Kinda like you are looking in a mirror.)

    Guitar Tab-ish 
        This layout is intended to be read like guitar tab. OR like looking down at your own guitar neck. al-ah shoe gaze. (Low strings in the bottom)

    Righty Instructor
        This layout is intended to be like the view of the guitar neck your right handed instructor, sitting directly in front of you.
        (Low strings are on top, Kinda like you are left handed, and looking in a mirror. OR Your a righty and you have to visually translate what your right handed instructor is showing you. Like most of us did, back in the day.)
